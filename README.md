# TCD1304-SPI
TCD1304 with 16biit 1MHZ ADC for SPI

This repository provides gerbers, schematic and BOM for a simple TCD1304 board with a 16bit 1MHZ ADC.
The SPI side can be 3.3 or 5V logic.  The Teensy 4 or 4.1 are the preferred controllers for reason of the their
480 MHz USB and 600MHz CPU.  

First examples have been built, and we will be updating this repository soon with new design files, firmware and python codes.
