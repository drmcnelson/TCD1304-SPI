# TCD1304-SPI
TCD1304 with 16biit 1MHZ ADC MCP33131D for SPI

This repository provides gerbers, schematic and BOM for a simple TCD1304 board with a 16bit 1MHZ ADC, the MCP33131D.
The SPI side can be 3.3 or 5V logic, meaning it should run with Teensy or Arduino type boards.
The Teensy 4 or 4.1 are good choices since they have the fast 480 MHz USB.

For a controller, please see the [T4 controller](https://github.com/drmcnelson/SPI-Instrumentation-Controller-T4.0) or [T4.1 controller](https://github.com/drmcnelson/SPI-Instrumentation-Controller-T4.1)

Caveat: this is a design only, I have not built the first one yet.  Sponsors are welcome.
Firmware and python user interace are usually available within a few weeks after making the first boards.
